abstract = {Abstract A version of Birkhoff's theorem is proved by constructive, predicative, methods. The version we prove has two conditions more than the classical one. First, the class considered is assumed to contain a generic family, which is defined to be a set-indexed family of algebras such that if an identity is valid in every algebra of this family, it is valid in every algebra of the class. Secondly, the class is assumed to be closed under inductive limits. (© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

  ABSTRACT = {In this work we present a novel formalization of universal algebra in Agda. We show that heterogeneous signatures can be elegantly modelled in type-theory using sets indexed by arities to represent operations. We prove elementary results of heterogeneous algebras, including the proof that the term algebra is initial and the proofs of the three isomorphism theorems. We further formalize equational theory and prove soundness and completeness. At the end, we define (derived) signature morphisms, from which we get the contravariant functor between algebras; moreover, we also proved that, under some restrictions, the translation of a theory induces a contra-variant functor between models.}

abstract = {The generality and pervasiveness of category theory in modern mathematics makes it a frequent and useful target of formalization. It is however quite challenging to formalize, for a variety of reasons. Agda currently (i.e. in 2020) does not have a standard, working formalization of category theory. We document our work on solving this dilemma. The formalization revealed a number of potential design choices, and we present, motivate and explain the ones we picked. In particular, we find that alternative definitions or alternative proofs from those found in standard textbooks can be advantageous, as well as "fit" Agda's type theory more smoothly. Some definitions regarded as equivalent in standard textbooks turn out to make different "universe level" assumptions, with some being more polymorphic than others. We also pay close attention to engineering issues so that the library integrates well with Agda's own standard library, as well as being compatible with as many of supported type theories in Agda as possible.},
