The Agda Universal Algebra Library is a project aimed at formalizing the foundations of
universal algebra, equational logic and model theory in dependent type theory
using Agda. In this paper we draw from many components of the library to present
a self-contained, formal, constructive proof of Birkhoff's HSP theorem in
Martin-L\"of dependent type theory.
This achieves one of the project's initial goals: to demonstrate the expressive power of
inductive and dependent types for representing and reasoning about general
algebraic and relational structures by using them to formalize a significant theorem in the field.
